### mirai + yum cha

![image](/assets/pop-up-yumcha-12-2024.png)

Pop-up with two editions:

- December 11 in Yum Cha
- December 12 in Mirai

Both dates won't be the same, we'll be adapting the propposal to each identity: in yum cha, it will be a 10-course menu with all the fine dining that mirai brings from past lives; and, in mirai, you'll experience a more informal concept, dishes to shares and everything Ã -la-carte.

If you want to go to yum cha, follow [the instructions posted on their ingragram account](https://www.instagram.com/p/DC7dX2sufnu/). You can book a space for December 12 at mirai's, [here](https://tienda.miraifoodlab.cl/product/yum-cha-mirai-pop-up).
