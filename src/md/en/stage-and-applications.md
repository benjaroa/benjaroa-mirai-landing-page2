# Internships and applications

We understand our kitchen as an open place, we don't like secrecy and it doesn't bother us at all to share.
the ways we work, our processes and the conclusions we have drawn.

We inherited the recipe and, likewise, we share it without any hesitation: that's why the scoby will always be free at Mirai. We believe that the difference is in the seasoning, technique, dedication, palate and in the implementation.

## Internships

Today we do not have an internship program as clear as we would like, but we hope to have one soon. In any case, if you want to come cook with us: you are totally welcome.

The experiments we have done so far have worked something like this:

- from one week to two months
- generally we do not pay salary, we do include tips and lunch
- we can adapt our agenda to try and do things that are within the intern's learning space
- we try to get them to go through all the sections of the restaurant, including the ramen bar on weekends
- we build, together, a work plan with boundaries (days, times, expectations) as clear as possible

## Applications

In general we don't believe much in CV's (that paper that describes the history of places where someone worked),
We prefer to make ourselves known and get to know others by working: we believe that working in a place has to do with comfort,
affinity, schedule, work pace, environment and not just technique. We bet on trying and seeing if we like working together, We are not afaid to make mistakes.

How the applications have worked so far:

- write to us through one of our networks (ideally, Instagram)
- come cook with us on a weekend (Saturday and/or Sunday, 9 am to closing)
- you need your knife, a jockey and an apron
- we do not pay for the day, but we do pay tips and we include lunch
- if you like it, and we like it, we can continue talking

If you have questions, you can write to us at [hola@miraifoodlab.cl](mailto:hola@miraifoodlab.cl), shoot us a message in the contact form, or directly through Instagram.
